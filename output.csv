133bh0h,157,Frontier Baggage Scam,"Literally saw something I have never seen in all my years of travel. Frontier gate agents literally terrorizing their customers. Threatening not to let them board at even the slightest bit of resistance. We arrived at our gate 3 hours before our flight and I carefully measured my whole families personal items in the bin. I should mention that this was our return flight using the same bags we arrived here with, no issues. It started with the lady directly in front of us in line. The agent asked her to measure her standard size backpack. When she tried to adjust the contents to get it to slide in easily and he says “no you have to pay” she clearly flustered turns to her daughter a few steps ahead who comes back and offers to move some items into her pack that is clearly minimally filled, the gate agent then threatens to not let either of them board the plane. The more they tried to reason with him the angrier he got. Then it was me, I wasnt worried, because I had already checked my bags during our wait, mine fit a bit snug, but size wise met the limitations on their website, also I had already seen several people board the plane with the exact same bag with no issues. My confidence, was misplaced. He points at me to put it in the bin, with a bit of a push it slides right down in, but the wheels were sticking out slightly, he tells me I have to pay also. One after the other after the other….. trust me I understand there are rules for a reason. But this was unreal. Everyone at the gate was in terror. One mom was in tears, alone with her young daughter because she couldn’t afford the cost, so she had to either leave the bag or miss her flight. Seems convenient to do this to people during boarding so people feel like they have no choice other than to pay or miss their flight. I don’t know if its true but a quick search on here shows that they are apparently paying their gate agents a commission of oversized baggage fees. Which explains a lot about our experience. This was my first time flying with Frontier and will certainly be my last. We generally fly Spirit and have never had a problem. I live in South Jersey so I have plenty of other options. Hope the $100 was worth it. If the gate agents were kind and respectful perhaps I would feel differently. But after what I witnessed I will never be a customer of theirs again.",negative
10bx7c4,139,Small Claims Court is Great for Air Travel Disputes,"Hi everyone, recently I flew Turkish to Ethiopia. It was a terrible flight experience to a beautiful country but I wanted to give advice to anyone else who might have been screwed by an airline. You can see my other posts here and here

https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/101ywvn/i_flew_turkish_but_they_cancelled_my/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/yw3saq/turkish_airlines_cancelled_my_connecting_flight/

To summarize, Turkish cancelled the second leg of my outbound flight and put me on an Ethiopian airlines flight instead some hours later after a lot of fighting. Ethiopian lost my carry on that they forced me to stow, which contained a brand new suit I was planning to wear to my friend's wedding. It never arrived while I was in Ethiopia. While in Ethiopia, Turkish cancelled my return flight the day I was meant to return and I just chose to fly back on United since Turkish had been so terrible. 

Once I got back to the USA, I tried to get my money back for the cancelled flight from Turkish and also tried to get Ethiopian to reimburse me for the luggage they lost (or send it to me). Turkish refused and Ethiopian just didn't respond to my emails and calls. I did a charge back for the cancelled flight through my credit card, but they owed me more based on Turkish law. They would not give me that. 

Eventually I got fed up and went to small claims court on 12/22 instead, suing Ethiopian for $1200 and Turkish for 600 Euro. It takes about 2 weeks for summons to be delivered to the party that's being sued, but as of today, my luggage was hand delivered to my house and Turkish has credited my card. 

Funny enough, Turkish tried only offering me 30k points at first, then followed up with another offer which I've attached here.

f0qq9o,116,Just Had an Older Woman Try to Take My Seat,"In India on Airline Indigo. I see a middle-aged woman and her mother in my aisle seat. I know exactly what they're going to try to do.



I say, ""I'm sorry, you're in my seat.""

The daughter says, ""Ah, yes, but she can't move,"" as she looks up at me, looking forcibly helpless.

""I'm sorry to hear that, but I paid (extra) for this seat.""

""Yes, but she can't move well."" 

*Then how did she get on the plane and into her seat in the first place?*

""I'm sorry, I need my aisle seat."" (I urinate frequently and if I was sat in the window seat, I'd obviously be trapped there for a three hour flight.)

The daughter looks at the flight attendant and says in Hindi that I paid extra for the seat.

The flight attendant comes over and says, ""I'm sorry sir, she can't move well, would you please take the window seat?""

""No, I'm sorry, I paid for an aisle seat. She can have my seat if you can offer me another aisle seat.""



I don't know why the flight attendant didn't offer this immediately instead of asking me to take the window seat or why they didn't place her in an **unoccupied** aisle seat to begin with. I just hate entitled people who thinks they can get whatever they want with puppy eyes. *At least* ask, don't tell.

buwy6x,108,What's your best not-a-tip when flying?,"I'm mostly a lurker here but it seems we get a lot of the same questions asked over and over. So I decided to compile a few helpful suggestions to make air travel easier for everyone:

1. Stand directly in front of the gate the instant, and I mean the instant, you see the gate agent so much as reach for the PA mic. Even if you're in group 42, it is critically important that you stand as close to the gate as humanly possible for as long as possible. If people push past you to board, scoff and loudly say ""EXCUSE ME"" to them.
2. When boarding, you can accelerate the process by asking the gate agent what group they just called, and then asking if you're part of that group, and then attempting to board no matter what they say.
3. Demand free upgrades. Yes, that couple on their honeymoon just paid $2500 for that pair of first class seats, but that doesn't mean that your $195 basic economy fare doesn't entitle you to the same treatment! The gate agents are usually pretty busy, so just throw a temper tantrum on social media.
4. You have a constitutional right to force your fellow passengers to put up with your emotional support ostrich on the aircraft. Asking you to fly three hours without it is technically a violation of the Geneva convention and subjects the airline to prosecution in an international tribunal.
5. If the airline has to cancel your flight for weather-related reasons, helpfully inform the gate agent about the current weather conditions at your current airport. It's impossible that the weather at your destination, at the origin of your inbound flight, or en route is problematic.
6. If your flight offers seatback entertainment, it's important that you tap the screen as hard as possible. Airline seats are massively over-padded, and the person sitting directly in front of you won't feel a thing. BONUS: The added momentum of your repeated taps will actually help the plane go faster.
7. Clap when the plane lands.

Can you think of any suggestions I might have missed?",neutral

I flew Norse Airways Roundtrip FLL to OSL mid-March. When I was checking in for my return flight, I was told by an agent my backpack was too big to be a personal item. I was confused because it fit in the sizer, but she said it was because I pushed my bag into the sizer (Video). As a result, I paid $120 USD to check my carry on, for which I had already paid the $45 USD carry-on charge. These are the same bags I flew with on the first leg of the trip, and I had no issues. I have flown with this backpack as my personal item on 20+ flights. Do other airlines have similar policies that I have been unaware of?

f2amsb,65,A couple of tips/tools for finding cheap Business Class flights,"Every day I search premium flight deals for others. And I have found some really good ones in the past :)

Normally Business Class seats are really expensive but airlines have a lot of sales and occasionally they make an error (which they do honor sometimes).  

Here are a few tools/sites you can use to find cheap business class flights:  


* **Google Flights**: I always start with their explorer tool. It's super convenient for spotting the cheapest destinations. Set your departing airport, travel dates, price limit and have fun spotting the best fares.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Flight Fare Compare**: most of the time you can find the same flight cheaper on Kayak, Momondo or Skyscanner. With this free Chrome extension, you can convert your Google Flight search into these 3 search engines, with one click.

&amp;#x200B;

* **ITA Matrix**:  the Matrix is a flight search engine designed by MIT computer experts (today owned by Google). On this site, you can find the 'flight rules' like: how long does a deal last or if it's possible to book a (free) stopover.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Newsletters**: you can join a free newsletter and receive alerts when there is a business class sale or an error fare.

x976gq,51,Finally got acceptable resolution from Delta/Virgin Atlantic for my involuntary downgrade from Delta One,"You might have seen my reddit post a couple months back complaining about my situation. I am writing this so other travelers that faced or will face the same situation will know what to do. 

**Backstory:** Used Virgin Atlantic miles (50K) to book Delta One flight from SEA to AMS. Checked-in on Delta app the day before and confirmed my seat, even selected the meal I wanted (Seabass.) However, on my way to the airport, I checked my app and saw that my seat has been changed from 6A to 30A but it still says Delta One. I knew I got downgraded but not sure why I didn't get any notification, email or text message about it. It's also hilarious that Delta still shows Delta One for row 30. Turns out, there was a equipment change so there weren't enough Delta One seats available.

**Unacceptable Resolution:** After landing, I chatted with Delta agent on Twitter and through email. They told me to contact Virgin Atlantic to get a refund and offered me $200 voucher for the trouble. I didn't think that was enough. After a while, another agent offered $300 but I still wouldn't accept it. At the same time, I also twitter and emailed Virgin Atlantic CS agent on the issue. At first, the CS agent replied back and said they couldn't do anything because this was a Delta flight. I told them that it was Delta that told me to contact VS. After both sides not wanting to do anything about my involuntary downgrade, I decided to do the first thing I should have done: **Filing a complaint with DOT.**

**DOT Complaint:** Thanks for the redditor that saw my post about this issue and suggested that I file a complaint to Department of Transportation. I filed it here:
[Air Travel Complaints](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/complaint-process#:~:text=Filing%20a%20complaint%20or%20comment%20with%20DOT.&amp;text=You%20may%20contact%20DOT%20by,submitted%20to%20DOT%20in%20writing.) I commented on my involuntary downgrade, both airlines not taking responsibility and attached my screenshot showing Delta calling my row 30 economy seat, ""Delta One."" DOT received and accepted my complaint and forwarded to Delta. Delta replied back and confirmed their receipt and is required to reply back with a resolution to me in 60 days.

**Acceptable Resolution:** After a couple weeks of waiting, I finally got a response and resolution from Delta. I was immediately given a voucher of $1000 to my Delta account and they have contacted VS to refund me the difference between economy and Upper Class miles which was 37500 VS miles. 

**TL;DR:** Involuntarily downgraded from Delta One (used VS miles.) Both airlines didn't take responsibility and offered no help. Filed complaint with DOT and got $1000 voucher and 37.5k VS miles back.",negative

aosq22,45,Crazy girl on my flight to Charlotte,"Not sure if this is the right place for this, but here goes...  this just happened about an hour ago.

So I just arrived to Augusta, for my flight to Charlotte, and made it through security.  As I'm gathering my things from security, I see a girl holding a tiny chihuahua.  Nothing too strange about that.  Then I hear one of the security personnel comment on how cute the dog is and ask her if she had a carrier with her.  The girl commented that no, she was carrying the dog on the plane and that it was a service dog... 

I mean I know some people pay online to have their dogs declared as service dogs but this was the first red flag about this girl.  I figured whatever. It's not bothering me so I don't care right?  

I make my way to the gate and sit down to wait for boarding for my flight to begin.  I see this girl walking around still carrying the dog and I begin to wonder to myself if this dog ever walks on it's own.  A few minutes later I see her walking towards me and she sits down next to me with her dog and starts to unwrap this pink popsicle looking food.  She starts eating it but is slowly pulling back the wrapper and letting the dog lick it.  Again, not bothering me, so I don't care.

When the person at the gate starts calling for people to board the girl instantly stands up and asks if they allow people with medical conditions to board first.... I would later come to hear her saying to a flight attendant on the plane that she had broken her tailbone and had some sort of spine issue.  She claimed her tailbone was broken due to a rough landing... 

So we are all getting ready walking out on the tarmac to board the plane when one of the personnel tells her that she can't bring her carry on and store it in the overhead compartments on the plane.  This is where things go from 0-100.  This girl starts screaming at the person helping people on the plane saying that she knows her bag will fit and that she needs it because her medication is on the plane.  The woman kindly tells her that she can take her medication out of the bag if she needs it but she cant bring her bag on the plane.

The girl continues to scream and swear at the flight attendant and all I can think is omg who does this girl think she is talking like that to people?  She tells the flight attendant that she wants to know her name and that shes going to be filing complaints against her and American airlines.  I just laugh as I walk by and shake my head but apparently this arguing went on for another 10 minutes while we were boarding.  They even threatened to put her on the no fly list if she didn't get on the plane because she was holding everyone up and acting extremely hostile.

At this point while I'm in my seat I think well at least I'm safe now right and we can finally relax.... nope.  This girl walks down the aisle and asks me, ""is this 17A?""  FML...  SHE SITS IN THE WINDOW SEAT RIGHT NEXT TO ME.   Now I'm just praying she doesn't start talking to me.  I politely tell her my seat belt is under her and I ask if I can get it.  I do and buckle up for a rough flight.  

This girl pulls out her cellphone and calls someone and immediately starts screaming about how the flight attendant started trying to ""physically rip"" her bag out of her hands away from her.  She said she would be filing a complaint with corporate and that none of the attendants would tell her their names.  No shit.  She continues screaming at this guy named Tom apparently on the phone and says, ""I'm never flying out of Augusta again.  Augusta is a fucking podunk, piece of shit airport with fucking drug addict security personnel."" She keeps screaming on the phone and everyone around me is laughing and telling me that I can move and sit with them if I want.  I was obviously uncomfortable with the situation and I wasn't trying to hide it.

Then the flight attendant walks by and she yells at the flight attendant to check and make sure her bag was on the plane... the flight attendant told her it was and assured her it was fine.  The girl then yells that she has a broken tailbone from a rough landing on a plane before.  She demands that they grab her pink flower pillow from her bag so she can have it fir her tailbone.  2 personnel with vests go grab her pillow and bring it on the plane.  Mind you this entire time she is still yelling at this Tom guy on her phone about how retarded he is for making her fly out of Augusta and that yes she knows what state she is going to.... apparently Tom was trying to calm her down and she asked him if he thought she was ""fucking stupid"".  I feel bad for Tom.  He caught the brunt of her anger over the phone.

Everyone around me was laughing and hoping she would be kicked off the plane and I just wanted to move away from her.  Luckily, some seats opened up a few rows up and they let me move up.  They told me I earned it for having to sit next to her and listen to all that.

Finally made it to the airport after only a 30-40 minute flight.  Headed to Dallas next.  Let's hope this next one is uneventful.

foyeev,48,PSA: If you are cancelling flights because you’re an immunocompromised traveler and can get a doctor’s note saying so... you can get a cash refund instead of flight credit.,"This was my situation. And I got this directly from a rep from Frontier. If you can get a doctor’s note saying you shouldn’t travel, and submit that doctor’s note. You can get a full refund. Even if you already opted for the future flight credit. 

This is a blessing for those that are immunocompromised and are hesitant to book flights until they know that the COVID crisis is over. If you have a clear medical reason not to travel you can still get a full refund.

Edit: IDK about “zero proof” or why this is so controversial. I was posting here a few days ago worried about this exact situation and called in, found this solution, and came back to tell you all that it worked for me. That’s the proof and here’s the links! I’m not worried about misuse, because if you didn’t have a legitimate reason you probably wouldn’t be able to get a doctor’s note anyway.

I literally picked up the phone and called the airline and their own rep walked me through to their website where you go here...

https://www.flyfrontier.com/travel/travel-info/travel-policies/

Scroll down to “illness”

Click on the link for “document submission form”

Upload your doctor’s note there and explain your circumstances in the text box.

If you are immunocompromised, all of your doctors are aware of this, so you might not need an in person visit to obtain the note. Call in to the office, explain what you need the note for, and they can upload it to your online health portal. Or secure email it to you. Then submit that document to the airline through the online form.

Their rep was the one who told me on their own that I could be refunded instead of being given flight credits. “Even if you cancel now and get the credit, once we receive your documentation we can process a refund” that’s what the Frontier rep said. That last point may vary across carriers, but TLDR: Refunds are possible for medical reasons

yx6k2t,43,Frontier’s “go wild” $599 unlimited flight pass — good deal or not really?,"Not sure if this is the appropriate thread to post this in, but I’m curious as to what others have to say about it. My main concern is the applicable  “taxes and fees” when booking the flight. For example, a flight from Rochester to Orlando that costs $85, out of that, only $8.73 is the airfare portion (which the pass would presumably be covering), and $75.85 are “taxes and fees.” That ratio is pretty standard for every flight. 

Do you think that the total taxes&amp;fees charged when using this pass would be less, and it would be more like booking an awards seat where you usually only pay like $5-6? Or is this just somewhat of a gimmick to really only save you 10-20% off a flight that you have to book day before? Which, to me, makes it not really worth it.

y46lgb,37,Review of my experience with Norse Airlines,"Norse is a new airline that only flies from Newark + Fort Lauderdale to Oslo, Norway. New routes are suppose to open to Berlin in December. I booked the flights several weeks ago and was hesitant because I had never heard of the airline, there were minimal reviews online + it is INSANELY cheap. I flew round trip from FLL to OSL for $320. 

Pros: Cheap as f!!, Friendly staff, Both of my flights left on time, Modern entertainment feature
&amp; Leniant baggage policy:
I paid for a piece of carry on luggage and I’m sure exceeded the dimensions allowed but no one checked nor cared.

Cons: I’m not sure if this is airline specific but you’re unable to get your boarding pass through online check in, you must go to the check in counter to receive the printed ticket with is a little annoying. In Florida there were literally zero line and 3 staff members jumped in to help me immediately. In Oslo there was about a 15 minute line for the check in counter. Not bad just annoying that this could be potentially bypassed. 

Similar to other budget airlines, they charge you for extra including: any meals/snacks, blankets, headphones, carry on baggage. But think of how much you’re saving on the flight! Just pack a lunch lol

I took a 10 hour flight during the day and there are no window shades. The windows have a changeable tint feature but they still allow light in so bring an eye mask if you plan on sleeping. 

Overall, I was weary about flying with this airline but I had a great experience. I would fly with them again!",neutral

ua0tvw,38,FYI - Alaska Airlines have cancelled 25+ flights which came through Seattle.,"The line for guest services is 3+ hrs long, the call queue is 8-10 hours. Most of this is overheard from flight attendants and various staff but apparently Air Force One had a security issue which shut down Seattle air space and backed Alaska Airlines up.


Combined with Alaska Airlines pilots being slightly understaffed, it’s created a nightmare situation. They are out of hotel vouchers.


Basically, if you have upcoming travel through Seattle today, double-check the status of everything. After experiencing a 4 hour flight delay followed by cancelling the connection and 3+ hours without getting to the front of guest services... if it’s not too late to stay home, I recommend that option.",negative
13v0fte,35,How a $3000 family flight turned into over $7000 with LOT Airlines. Do I have any recourse?,"**Original cost for 3 tickets: \~$3200**

My family (wife and 1.5-year-old) and I showed up at LAX for our flight to Ljubljana on May 3rd. They took our passports to check us in and told my wife that she couldn't fly because her name on the passport didn't match the name on the reservation. I had mistakenly booked the flight using her current last name (we married 3 years ago), but her passport was still in her maiden name. I asked whether there is anything we can do, and the LOT representative gave me a number to call and told me to request a name change. In hindsight, I do not even think this service was associated with LOT and was some other agency.

I was in a state of panic that we would not be able to take this trip we had been planning for 6 months and wanted to do whatever I had to do to get us on this flight. I called this number, and the agent said that it was too close to the time of the flight to perform a name change on the ticket (you had to be 3 hours out from the flight, and it was 2:30 hours before departure). He said the only option was to buy a new ticket, but it would be $3000. I said, ""Okay, let's do it."" Note: looking at the credit card charge, there were 2 charges, one was to LOT airlines, and one was an AGENT FEE for about $1200. The LOT agent apologized and told me to request a refund when we get to Europe.

**New total: $6200**

In Europe, I requested a refund on LOT's WhatsApp service and explained the situation. A day later, I got a message that it was approved, but when I looked at my credit card history, I see that only about $200 was refunded. I reached back out to LOT, and they said that they only refund the tax because that is the policy.

**After refund cost: $6000**

Fast forward 3 weeks, I'm checking in to return home, and I search my wife's new booking reference ID, and it says ""not found."" I contact LOT again, and they say that when they issue a refund, they cancel the flight. I say that's ridiculous, how is my wife getting home? They say she needs a new ticket. So I buy a new ticket for $1200.

**Total cost: $7200.**

I realize I could've prevented this at several points; not booking under the wrong name or reading the fine print of the refund policy before accepting the refund. I still feel like this is shady business on their part and wonder if I have any recourse.",negative

vuxe2d,35,Awful experience with Saudi Airlines. Best way to get my compensation and rights?,"I am not trying to rant here but I just need to briefly tell my story:

Booked a flight from Frankfurt to Jakarta together with my wife, for departure 23th of June and return on 4th of July. Our standard baggage allowance was 2x23Kg for each of us, and since I haven't come home for a long time I decided to bought an extra baggage to carry my chocolate gifts for my family. Here are the list of problems we had:

&amp;#x200B;

* On 20th of June, I was just checking my booking on their website and suddenly I received a pop up saying that I had to approve new schedule for my return flight, it was moved from 4th of July to the 6th July. No prior emails whatsover. I was shocked and furious because I had important meeting on the 6th of July so I called their customer service right away. They told me they would look for other flights. After almost an hour of waiting they told me they couldn't find any. I just accepted my defeat and informed my company right away that I couldn't attend the meeting.
* On 23th of June, when we arrived at the Frankfurt airport, to another shock we saw in the airport timetables that our flight was CANCELED. Again with NO emails from Saudi to inform this. Then I waited for like 4 hours in a queue in front of their counter to get my replacement flight. The ticketing staff told me that there was a flight the next day with different airline (Qatar Airways) but that means I had to give up my baggage allowance PLUS my extra baggage that I bought. Other alternative was to take the next flight from Saudi but it was on 25th of June and they would provide the hotels and the meals for the duration until the next flight. I took this alternative since I didn't want to lose my baggage allowance and Qatar Airways baggage allowance was only 25kg per passenger, so the baggage allowance different was pretty big.
* While I was waiting for more info of our hotel and meal allowance with the other affected passengers, a manager from Saudi Airlines approached me (he seemed angry) and asked me why I didn't take the next day flight. I explained the reason regarding my extra baggage that I bought. The next sentence that came out from his mouth still made me furious to this day: ""Just pay the difference of your baggage, I don't want to pay for your hotel and meal for 2 days"". He then escorted me back to the ticketing counter and demanded the ticketing staff to put me in the next day flight with Qatar Airways. The ticketing staff then explained to him that I had problem with my baggage allowance and the next day flight was already full anyway. Then the manager told me to pay the second night myself. After some heated arguments between me and him, another Saudi staff lady told me just go to the hotel they provided, while she tried to explain the situation again to her manager in Arabic.

That's not the end of the story, the final blow to us was when we reached our hotel. The receptionist told us that the Saudi manager HAS NOT PAID the room for us, but he did for other passengers who were staying for a night. My wife literally broke crying out of anger. The receptionist tried to call Saudi Airlines again but they were not unreachable because it was already late at night. After waiting some time the receptionist told us that there was another couple who still hadn't showed up so we could take their room for the night. Finally we spent the night there and the receptionist called them again in the morning and finally they did pay for us.

&amp;#x200B;

Again sorry for the long story and rant, but I just want to know the best way to get my compensation of the both delayed flights and no information in any form whatsover regarding the delays. And also especially how can I report the manager since his treatment to us was really unacceptable since we were the ones at disadvantage but he demanded us to pay extra for the inconvenience they caused. I was thinking to fill the complaints form but not sure if this is the best way.",negative
ovggwq,32,PSA: Traveling in Times of the Delta Variant,"This (or something like it) should probably be added to the FAQ, but when COVID first hit, there were a **lot** of questions in this sub about cancellations, refunds, reticketing, and so forth. It's worth bringing this up again as the Delta variant of COVID is bringing back travel restrictions.

Public Service Announcement:

Generally speaking, it's always better to book your tickets directly with the airline rather than a third party travel agency, or especially a third party online travel agency (Expedia, Trivago, etc.). This sub is full of horror stories saying ""yes, Delta canceled my flight. They tell me Trivago is issuing my refund. Trivago tells me they're waiting for Delta. It's been six months. What do I do?""

Generally speaking, if your flight has been canceled *by the airline*, you are eligible for a refund. The specifics are up to your specific airline, but I'm aware of no airlines right now who are giving cash refunds for any other type of cancellation. Read the terms carefully before booking. After you've booked, the airline generally doesn't care about the following scenarios: 1. you don't want to go on your trip anymore because you don't think it's safe; 2. your event in your destination city got canceled; 3. the thing you were going to see in your destination city is closed for the foreseeable future; 4. you can no longer afford the time off; 5. your destination won't let you in because you're a tourist/you're transiting through a certain country/you're unable to provide proof of vaccination. 

When you bought the economy/basic economy/economy plus ticket, you explicitly agreed to ""yes, I understand I'm paying relatively little for this flight, compared to my fellow passengers up there in first/business. The reason you're offering this deal/price break is because I understand that to receive this price break, I'm giving up my ability to cancel my ticket and receive a full cash refund/choose where I sit/not pay for my drinks and snacks/have you carry my baggage for free/etc.""

Before you say ""well, I'll just talk to my bank and do a chargeback,"" save yourself the time and embarrassment. Your bank is going to talk to the airline, who has teams of people who point out ""hey, this person is not eligible for a full refund, here's where we told them and where they agreed to it,"" and the bank will say ""yup, you're right"" and won't give you your money back. A chargeback *might* be valid in the situation I outlined above where you couldn't get a straight answer from either Delta or Trivago within six months, but part of the terms you agree to with your bank is that before you file a chargeback, you'll make a good faith effort to resolve the situation with the vendor (airline), and they'll likely tell you to get lost if you haven't done so.

That isn't to say that you can't cancel your plans; however, as I said above, the vast majority (like, none that I know of) of airlines are not handing cash back to you in the event of a cancellation (unless you purchased a specific fare of ticket which allowed for free cancellations). They'll only give you an opportunity to rebook, or a credit on the books (in the form of dollars or miles/points), which needs to be used within a certain timeframe. 

Remember, many of these flights are still going because they're open to residents, citizens, and foreign nationals of that country. One cannot assume that ""well, they aren't letting tourists in, so of course the flight will be canceled.""

On the positive side, if the flight *is* canceled, or it's changed significantly, then generally you will be eligible for a full refund, which depends on the origin and destination countries involved. Check your local traveler protection rights for further information.

Anyways, I don't work for the banks or the airlines, but I do fly a bunch, and actually have had a ton of travel cancelled thanks to COVID, so I hope this helps, and happy travels!",negative
v4mwn6,35,Lufthansa gone rogue - what do I do?,"6 weeks ago I bought a Lufthansa ticket Copenhagen-Frankfurt-Singapore-Darwin. Each of the layovers being 6 hours long. Bought straight from Lufthansa, all the same ticket, surely nothing could go wrong. I figured it'd be nice to have my plane ticket sorted before my upcoming exams.

 I then received an email saying that unfortunately, my last flight (Singapore-Darwin) had been cancelled and that they'd rebooked me to the same flight 24 hours earlier (yes, that means a -18 hour layover). I may be used to travelling, but I still have not learnt time travel. I called them, he insisted I pay for the fare difference because I had used my free rebooking. He also did not seem to see the problem with my ticket. He refused to transfer me to someone else so I could avoid the 30 minute wait, because clearly they'd give me the same answer. 

 I called again, this time she was very understanding. She rebooked me and upgraded the leg to business class. I then just had to wait 24 hours for a booking confirmation. No problem. I didn't receive one. When I went to check online, it said the booking reference did not exist. I logged in, and there was my ticket, all sorted. Perfect. I checked a couple days later, and suddenly the Singapore-Darwin leg was simply gone. I didn't receive any kind of notification.

 I called again. Argued with someone again because no, I do not want to pay extra to add a ticket to the destination that I bought my ticket for. She finally gave in, and upgraded the leg to business class. I waited for a booking confirmation again. It didn't come. I checked online again, everything looked fixed (apart from the booking reference still being non-existent).
Then yesterday I checked again, and they have once again simply removed the ticket to Darwin. 

What do I do? I feel like I'm running in circles. I certainly did not expect buying a ticket with a reputable airline to be a full-time job, yet here we are.",negative
12i50s8,31,Anyone else find it a pain in the ass to fly to the US?,"Whether you’re a US citizen or not, flying to the US from abroad always comes with a little extra and it depends where you’re flying from/which airport. 


I remember flying from the Istanbul Airport in Turkey. When you approach the gate, they have someone asking for your boarding pass and passport. Then they let you enter the line where you’re funneled through and you have like 5 checkpoints where they ask for your boarding pass and passport. Then at the final checkpoint, they do a security check where they pat you down, make you take off your shoes, look through your stuff before you finally get to sit down at the gate. 


In Brussels recently, they didn’t let us check in online for the flight. It was because we had to see an agent in person, and get a sticker on the back of our passports that said “Securitas”. On top of that, a lot of poor bastards such as myself had the “SSSS” on my boarding pass which meant extra security check at the gate. Pat down, shoes off, look through your stuff. It made boarding take longer. 


In other airports I’ve seen special gates or areas to go to for US-bound flights only. Seems like the US takes its security pretty seriously, perhaps paranoia of another 9/11 happening. Have you ran into similar procedures flying to the US?",negative

I get that they probably can manage to buy the tickets cheap as they buy the tickets in bulk and resell them.

I ended up booking through the airline instead anyway as I don't want to get brain damage dealing with a third-party company with all the horror stories I see on this sub.  


But if everyone else is telling people to avoid them then how are they still in business? Is there an actual scenario where booking through a third-party website instead of directly with the airline would be viable? Could I have booked through the third-party website instead?",negative
x3d2mn,30,I flew Norse Atlantic Airways from NY to Berlin and it was a good experience,"I got the basic ticket but upgraded to the next level to get a checked bag option plus a meal. I opted not to select a seat for additional $. I figured on an 8 hour flight departing at 12:30am, I would be fine with whichever seat as most of us would be sleeping through the night. Here are some thoughts on the process at the airport:

Check-in: The counters were being served by people in generic clothes so I don't think they were dedicated Norse Airways folks. The young girl was a bit snappy and preferred to look at her phone but she checked me in so whatever.

Waiting for flight: Nothing unusual here. Announcements to board the flight were made and people boarded the aircraft. Flight took off on time! Very pleased with that.

In-cabin: I was assigned a middle seat. The row next to ours was empty so the aisle guy moved over. Thanks dude! I'll be honest, it WAS nice having an empty seat next to me for the flight. 

Seat was fine with the usual leg room. The cabin was new so that was a nice change from other planes I've been on recently. There was a decent selection of in-flight entertainment. I had my own headphones. Pretty sure they'd charge you for those if you didn't bring yours. Good thing I was wearing a hoodie and pants because it was cold during the flight. Blankets were $5 so that's always an option.

Meal: Underwhelming. I'd asked for a vegan option and I was given a little sandwich with some vegetables between bread and 2 soft fig cookies. It was edible but I did expect a hot meal for some reason. Drinks (non-alcoholic) were free for everyone which was nice.

Toilets: Basic with just soap available.

Landing: All good, landed on time.

Aircraft personnel: Lovely people, eager to make a good impression.

Overall, it was a pretty good experience for a budget airline. I'd definitely take it again and maybe bring my own meal and blanket next time.",positive

The couple in front of me and directly across the aisle turned their heads and looked at my row.

12zzddv,29,Gate sign not updated -- am I at fault?,"In Addis Ababa, dealing with Ethiopian Airlines. Was at my connecting gate 10 mins before **boarding**. Saw a huge line, took a seat, and waited for the line to get smaller. The line remained massive well after boarding time started, but the gate sign continued to say ""BOARDING"" for my flight.

Around departure time, I decided to get up and ask how long the presumed delay would be. I was told my flight had already begun to depart.

The sign still said ""BOARDING"" for my flight. There was still a huge lineup at my gate, but it was in anticipation of the next flight. In all their brilliance, they allowed to flights to line up at th same gate and never updated the sign to say ""Final call"" or even ""Departing"" after the flight had left.

I got a video of the sign and the line after it had departed. I spoke to customer service reps. They said they would book me for tomorrow, meaning I would miss three paid days of work (weekends are counted at my work -- long story), and now they even have the gall to tell me *I* have to pay for my own hotel while I wait 24h for my next flight.

Is it just me or is this utterly ludicrous?

**Edit: after seeing the video I took, the airline agreed to rebook our tickets and pay for our hotel rooms. Take this as a lesson to always document this sort of thing.

Due to a late departure, I was rescheduled for the second leg of my flight (Istanbul to Europe) by nearly 4 hours. I was at the gate to board my replacement flight - but was denied boarding at the gate with no explanation. I was at the gate half an hour before boarding began. I followed instructions and boarded when it was my turn. They scanned my boarding pass several times, and I heard one attendant say overbooked to another, and I was told to step aside. They continued to board others, then another attendant tried again several times while making some calls. Then, without explanation, he told me “next flight, wrong gate” - and escorted me out of the gate. He did not answer why I was not allowed on. 

After over an hour at the ticketing counter, I was told the flight was not overbooked and that there were several vacant economy seats in the flight. They told me that the agents said I was not at the gate on time and I missed my flight. I showed them the passenger rights document - the next replacement flight was 4 hours later - making me late to my destination by nearly 10 hours. They said that because I was late, I was not entitled to anything to contact their help center. 

They replied to me within an hour stating that records show I did not make it to the gate on time. Absolutely false. I reopened the claim.

10p5adr,28,I finally received my baggage after 40 days from Delta/Air France,"Hey! Just wanted to share my story in case there were any others out there that lost their baggage around the holiday season. On Dec. 19th, I was flying from VIE to CDG to RDU to ATL to TPA. A ton of connections- so many that my bags needed two tags each. Instead, the Vienna airport worker put one tag on each bag. So I received one of my bags at the end of my journey, but the second sat in Paris for 40 DAYS. Yes, FOUR - ZERO. I literally had lost all hope after 3 weeks.

I spent countless hours waiting on the phone for customer service, texting with rude employees on the Delta iMessaging service, and spent my money and time driving 2 hours there and back to the nearest airport several times so I could talk to someone in person.

The moral of the story is don't give up if your bag is still missing! As long as you know where it's sitting at, don't worry. I know it really blows. I had to replace several things in my bag that Delta won't reimburse me for due to the fact that I didn't buy the things in the first 5 days without my bag. But don't give up on your bag!

8y1l8w,28,"How Spirit Airlines make their ""voucher"" practically a scam","Last month I had a flight canceled by Spirit for no reason. A week later I contacted customer service and an email came back with a $50 voucher for my inconvenience. Typical compensation. OK.

Problem is that when I tried to use the voucher today on a $71 flight (plus $31 tax) the website told me voucher is invalid. Huh?

So I called, and the guy on the phone said I could not use the voucher because the $71 flight price is further broken down to a number of different ""charges"" such as ""passenger usage charges"" (wth is that? it's $40 of the $71 in this case) etc. And the voucher can only apply to a ""flight portion"" within the flight price. Guess what the ""flight portion"" of this $71 flight is? $0

So now I see it. They break down the air fare into 5 different ""charges"" and ""fees,"" assign $0 to a ""flight portion"" and all the cost in the others, so that your voucher is useless. Smart.

I went through three Spirit Airlines agents and supervisor and manager and I was impressed how they're trained to basically repeat the same lines ""you cannot use the voucher because that's how the system/our guideline works""

One of them even said ""maybe you can choose a different route but I think that'd cost you more after the $50 voucher""... sure, might as well print on your voucher ""use on overpriced flights only""

By the way, I told them I'd report the case to Business Bureau and the press and they didn't seem to care. I found out why - I googled it up and there are already dozens of press publications on how Spirit employs various tricks to prevent customers from redeeming their vouchers. 

So I guess I'll just submit a bureau complaint and move on. But next time they offer you a voucher. Know that they're probably giving you next to nothing.

118wtqj,28,Never fly air India,"Paid roughly $4k for a business class round trip ticket from SFO &gt; BLR. On the way it was fine - the seats reclined, the door to the aisle sorted of needed help, but all in all comfortable and service was excellent.

On the way back not only is the flight delayed (ok every flight is delayed), but the flight configuration has changed. Where I thought I'd booked a single seat, it's actually an aisle next to someone. They have a 2:3:2 configuration in business class.

The seat itself is broken - the TVs are old. At most this seat should have cost $1.8k. Shame on Air India and Tata for continuing to run old crappy planes with the same modern prices.

I requested a first class seat since those look decent but was told it was too close to take off to change. Mind you we are sitting here an hour after I requested the change. Instead I was berated by a women who told me nothing could be done. All in all the reviews you’ve heard are true. Too sad for Tata taking over a decrypt airline.

ztt38s,29,Expedia f**kked up my flight tickets and made me buy new expensive ones after more than 12 hours of communicating and waiting.,"I planned trip to Japan and bought tickets on Expedia end of September for a trip on 23rd December 2022. It was a co-share Air Canada and Singapore Airlines ticket. 

The trip was just around the corner and am super excited to check-in online, only to find that my tickets were missing!! We contacted Expedia customer service to enquire about the situation around 1:40PM.

The customer service was trying to string us along. They gave us all different kinds of explanation when we were looking for solutions due to their mistake.

1. They told is flight has been cancelled and next available flight is in February 2023. 

Absolutely hilarious. There are still available tickets and is flying on schedule. We sent in additional documents to show that it is not cancelled so they said they'll check again.

2. They said it is our fault for not contacting them when changes are made on the tickets.

The changes were about the change of flight time and Airlines in charge of the ticket. We were never informed of the ticket cancellation. They blamed us for not reaching out when they should have been the one to reach out and explain to us?

3. Customer service said he couldn't handle it and need to connect us to higher team while contacting Airlines. 

Expedia also said they're going to call us but we waited for over 2 hours and they just say they are handling it. It has already been over 4 hours now. We were told to wait because they are on hold for at least 2 hours.

We contacted Air Canada and was on hold about 3 hours before reaching the customer support to ask for help. We also contact Singapore Airlines to handle this situation. Singapore Airlines confirmed that our ticket is still available and Expedia just has to issue us the ticket.

However Expedia refused to do so and told us to wait continuously for another few hours again, saying they're handling it.

After another 4-5 hours of wait and continuous communication, we were told to be transferred to the higher team. They connected us to the supervisor and then told us they don't have a solution and need to connect to the Singapore Airlines again, wait time at least 2 hours, still no solution at this point.

The flight ticket price sky rocketed since afternoon and wayyyy more expensive than when we bought the tickets.

At around 1:40AM, we were told to buy new tickets if we insist on travelling. They are making us pay for their mistake, and they never admitted their fault.",negative
yw15j2,26,First international flight upcoming - can you explain to me like I'm 5?,"So, on Friday I'm flying to Boston (Logan Airport) from Greece with two layovers.

My itinerary is SKG-ATH-ZRH-BOS.

So, I've done a ton of research, my papers are ready (EU vaccine certification, ESTA, travel insurance, attestation form) but I still have a few questions.

1. Do I go through security at every airport I'm transiting?
2. Will they check my passport/papers when I board first (SKG), then before flying to USA (ZRH) and then when I get there? (BOS)
3. About security: I'm carrying a laptop which will be put on a tray on its own. Then on another tray I'll put my shoes, jacket, bag, liquids bag and whatever I have in my pockets? If my phone and keys are in the carry on or the jacket pockets, do I just leave them there? Do i need to show my power bank too? Also, I'll be carrying some otc painkillers and some packaged snacks (like cookies and chocolates). From my understanding I don't need to present them and they can stay in the carry on, is that correct?
4. Am I clearing customs and immigration only in Boston? Am I taking my checked in bag once I've cleared them?

eq5lbx,27,Emirates is receiving hundreds of complaints on social media from concerned passengers worried that Emirates are still flying over Iraq. Would Redditors feel safe flying with Emirates now?,"I'm an aviation enthusiast and the latest situation with Iran has sparked my interest in how airlines have reacted. It seems that Emirates in particular are under fire from customers who feel they are not prioritizing safety. 

The latest official advice given to airlines and pilots reads as follows: 

&gt; ""There was an Iranian missile strike on US military bases in Iraq on Jan 8, quickly followed by the shooting down of Ukraine Int Airlines flight 752 in Tehran by the Iranian Armed Forces, having mistaken the aircraft radar return for an inbound missile to Tehran.
&gt; 
&gt; In the days following these events, many countries issued warnings to avoid the airspace of Iran and Iraq. We now classify both these countries as Level 1 - Do Not Fly airspace. Tehran and Baghdad FIRs are off limits.
&gt; 
&gt; Most airlines other than Middle Eastern carriers have now stopped overflying Iraq entirely. Traffic that normally operates through the Baghdad FIR now needs another route. The predominant choice for east-west flights into the Dubai area is a southerly routing via Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The aviation security picture in the Middle East, already fragile and unstable, is now unpredictable.""

Due to the accessibility of flight paths on websites like FlightRadar, passengers are checking their Emirates flights and seeing that the company continues to fly directly over Iraq in a northeast to southeast direction on routes to Dubai from the West and the opposite direction from Dubai to the West. 

If you had an upcoming flight with Emirates, would you be comfortable during the point at which your plane is flying over Iraq, knowing the current state of affairs? Should Emirates change their routes? An increasing number of passengers are taking to social media to complain.",negative

I dont have a US visa and it was my first time leaving Mexico. When I went to the counter to check my bag and get my tickets the lady took awhile to look at my passport. She noticed that I have never used it before and asked if it was my first time traveling internationally. I told her yes and she started to ask me for proof of a return trip which I had but with a different airline. She then asks to see proof of hotels which I provided but she got angry that I didn't have the receipts of payments because my fiance paid for it. I just had the reservation information. Then she started to accuse me of trying to illegally immigrate to Canada. After some time of me answering all of her questions and her getting more annoyed with me she finally gave me my tickets and took my checked bag. 
When I got to Canada my checked bag did not show up. I went to the luggage desk to see what happened and the were unable to find my bag in the system. Finally after a few days of calling the airline and going to the airport customer service they realized the my bag was tagged to a different name going to a different city and the date was for 2 days before I even left to go to Canada. We finally got my bag but lost a lot of time on our short trip trying to solve what happened. All of the airport staff seemed really confused and like they have not had this happen before. So I guess I am curious with the computer system that they use to check your bag at the the airport how easy is it to accidentally put the wrong tag on someone's suitcase. I feel like it was done on purpose but maybe I am overreacting.

In short - flew from Mexico to Canada. My checked back was tagged with the wrong Name, Destination and Date. Anyone who has worked a checkin desk for an airline. How easy it to mess this up?",negative

z6vhxj,25,FLM KLM worst flight experience,"This is a long one but here we go. My wife and I are currently stranded in Dar Ed salaam. We were on KLM flight KL515 from zanzibar to Amsterdam with a brief stop in Dar Es salaam.

     The flight was to depart at 22:20 in zanzibar and it did so for a quick flight to pick up/ drop off passengers in dar es salaam.  We arrive and passengers left and got on when we were supposed to leave 1+ hour after the captain announced that they have a leak in the plane’s tire and they need to replace it. After another hour he said that they located a tire and they were in the process of repair. After another hour they announced that tire is the wrong tire and they cannot fly. After another 1+ hour they announced they announced that they need permission to exit the plane.

         So here is the kicker, during the waiting of the deplaning KLM assured us that they would be finding accommodations for passengers or compensate passengers who can do it themselves. So at 04:00 we deplaned and had to go into a line of 200+ people to go through customs to grab our bags. 5-6 hours of going no where.

    After we exited customs we were met with an agent who handed us a sheet of paper stating in short “we could not find any accommodations for you you need to figure it out for yourself.”

     As the plot thickens klm has no customer service line we finally found a hotel at 07:00  slept for 5 hours. My wife managed to contact a agent via text WhatsApp and they said they couldn’t help us. 

Currently I acquired a SIM card to call the Tanzanian office to which no answer from them called by myself and the airport authority.  It sits at 15:35 no remarks or emails from klm. 


Update: day 2 Nov 28 KLM has no idea what is going on and they have rescheduled the flight again another 24 hours 3 day delay. The agents don’t even have a phone number to call headquarters in Amsterdam they have no idea what is going on, we were brought to a hotel and had to spend the night. They announced that we would not be flying again for another 24 hours at 10pm. Zero communication for almost 24 hours. 

Nov29.  Day 3 We have tried to get KLM to books us on an Air France flight. But because we are “Checked in” on KL515 they cannot transfer us. We talked to the klm representative here in Dar es salaam and they said we need to talk to klm book and the booking services said we need to talk to the klm representatives at the airport .  So far there is a post get on to ether flight because we are now book on both. The right had doesn’t know what the left hand is doing.

We called their customer support who told us this was because of bad weather and because of that we would probably not be eligible for compensation by EU laws, but we could get the money of the flights back.  We obviously cancelled because there was no point in going for 2 days.

Now we lost the money for the hotel and are supposedly not eligible for compensation for that from TAP.

On the next day we see online that both flights happened with no problem, so we call them again. Now they tell us that they were not cancelled in the end but one flight got delayed. We ask them why they moved our flight and get no decent answer. We ask them then to put us on the next flight because online we can see there are still available seats and they say there's nothing they can do since we already cancelled and we should now do a separate booking (this is now very expensive so we don't do it). The whole time they provide no help or explanation and just kept redirecting us to submit a complaint on their website or buy new tickets without even being refunded first.

On top of all that, they let you cancel the flight very easily, but to actual request a refund you have to go through a very difficult process that creates a request on their side instead of automatically processing it with the cancelation, and we're still waiting to hear from them. The complaint for additional compensation is equally difficult.

qf21e4,26,Qatar Airways compensation avoidance/delay tactics,"**tl;dr – With flight to and originating from the EU, you don’t need to use a paid service to get your compensation from an airline that refuses to deal with you in a fair manner. You can use a free (and in my experience effective) mediation service.**

Recently, Qatar Airways cancelled our flight from an airport in Germany to a destination in Asia, resulting in a delay of about a week. As they had not given us two weeks advance notice and the delay was over four hours, they owed us a compensation of €600 (about US$700) per person, according to the [EU passenger rights regulations ](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm).

I wrote an E-mail to the Qatar Airways customer service. They took over three weeks to respond with a completely generic reply that did not address the issue of compensation at all.

I could have used a company like [FlightRight](https://www.flightright.de/), but they would have taken a commission of 20–30% plus 19% VAT which would have amounted to up to about €215 (US$250) per person, so I decided to use the free mediation service of [the SÖP](https://soep-online.de/). I entered all the information on their website and got a confirmation E-mail on the following working day. The application was quite long, but FlightRight’s form unsurprisingly required exactly the same information, so it wasn’t any less convenient to use the free service of SÖP.

Not much longer, and Qatar Airways responded. Now they said that they would pay _me_ €600, but that my family members (spouse and one minor child) would have to submit their own applications. My spouse signed a power of attorney and I submitted this to SÖP together with a copy of my child’s birth certificate as proof that I am their legal guardian.

Some few weeks later, Qatar Airways agreed to pay the full amount of €1,800. They made it very complicated, again: I had to fill in a very user-unfriendly online form, upload copies of our passports as well as a release form also containing an NDA. As this form was so difficult to access, it took me over one hour to fill it in completely and submit it. This was about two months after the flight. I hope that that is it and we will get the money soon.

**My suggestion to you:** If an airline tries to deny you the compensation you are due, don’t let them get away with it. The EU probably stipulated such a high compensation in order to make it unattractive for airlines to cancel flights because there aren’t enough passengers. Qatar Airways likely speculates that many passengers will give up asking for a compensation if they just make it difficult enough for them.",negative

&gt; Dear &lt;name&gt;,

&gt; Given the unprecedented situation we’re all facing as a result of Covid-19, we wanted to provide an update on what this means for any travel plans you may have with easyJet.

&gt; We will continue to operate a flight schedule that ensures that those customers who still wish to travel can do so, where travel restrictions allow and in line with guidance from health authorities.

&gt; However, we understand there is uncertainty around travel at this time, so if you currently have a booking with us but would prefer not to fly then from tomorrow (13.03.2020), you can now change your flight online and we will waive the flight change fee. This applies to all existing and new bookings until further notice. Should there be a difference in fare you’ll need to pay this - however by waiving the change fee, we want to ensure you have more flexibility to amend your travel plans.

&gt; Where we’ve been required to cancel flights, customers will be able to transfer to an alternative flight free of charge or receive a refund. And where all flights have had to be cancelled due to local authority guidance – in Italy, for example – we are operating rescue flights to ensure passengers can return home.

&gt; To change your travel plans, please visit the Manage Bookings section on easyJet.com. This is not only the simplest way to make changes but, given the call volumes we are currently experiencing, this will also be the quickest.

&gt; Please note that if you do need to call the Contact Centre to make a change, there will be an administration charge of £5 applied per person, per flight – so we really do encourage you to make your changes online. Clearly, if you require special assistance when booking, this fee will be waived.

dqwtam,26,"American Airlines mishandled our honeymoon. Flights were delayed, new connections were booked wrong (then cancelled and never fixed). Now AA can't find our luggage. How should I get help?","Any type of help is appreciated, my Wife and I got virtually stranded before our Honeymoon could even start.

There's a lot of moving parts here, and I've kept a list of names and timestamps when dealing with American Airlines (AA) - but for you, kind reader, I'll try to stay big picture. It's a lot to take in, but we could really use your help to save what's left of our Honeymoon. 

American Airlines was paid 5K for my wife and I to travel to New Zealand for our honeymoon.  We had three legs to our trip: our Hometown to LAX, then to Auckland, and finally Queenstown.

The wife and I packed two bags with all our gear and clothing (Itemized at 3.8K) for two weeks of exploring nature in NZ. We had booked a honeymoon suite in Queenstown (1.5K) for our arrival, and paid 3K to rent an RV. We wanted to spend our honeymoon in NZ to see the country and explore. I mention the price only because it's lost to us, and that total cost may influence your advice. 

To start our journey, when the wife and I arrived at our Hometown airport, Baggage Check In was backed up. It was so bad that our flight got delayed waiting for the bags, and then we got delayed further by bad weather. When the wife and I arrived at LAX, we missed our connecting flight by minutes. (During the last hour of the flight, AA staff confirmed for us several times they were holding our connection at the gate, but that communication didn't actually occur.)

We were paged over the loudspeakers, and LAX staff with AA gave us a hotel coupon. The wife and I would need to wait for 24 hours until our next flight was ready. We were handed info for our new flights, and provided with a few small meal vouchers that didn't even cover breakfast.

The same AA contact at LAX said to first go to baggage claim and have them retrieve our belongings. The bags would need to be taken with us since AA rebooked us on another airline. The AA contact provided us with info stubs  tickets that detailed two brand new legs of travel - we were flying further out to Sydney, Australia for reasons we still don't understand. 

With this info we walk down to baggage claim, where AA's staff told us our belongings were still stuck in our hometown. So the wife and I paid out of pocket to feed and dress ourselves until the next flight.

We used the downtime to rest, and confirm our Honeymoon suite delay. The suite was a gift from my Father In Law, so we worked through him to confirm the new times. 

A day later, the wife and I showed up to our flight at LAX to find the new tickets created by AA had been canceled. Hours later, we had gone through three AA staff and supervisors to get tickets for yet another later flight - but at lest we were back to flying with AA on our way to Auckland. 

When the Wife and I got off that new AA flight this morning, we discovered that AA had booked the final leg to Queenstown on a flight two days earlier. It also turns out none of the info we were given by the LAX staff with AA had ever been created. It was keyed in but never paid/processed/approved. So even with the wrong day, there still wasn't a record to move. 

We had to run across Auckland Airport four times to straighten out AA's mistake, and eventually booked yet another later flight. It took both of us and all our time to fix this (Important later). 

At this point, my wife and I have missed two+ days of our honeymoon. We decided to check on the status on our bags while waiting in Auckland. One bag was STILL in our hometown, the other was now... lost. We're not sure how they separated, both bags were checked in together. 

So as we take our last leg in to Queenstown, we think we're finally set. It's been three days since the first delay, and when we arrive at our Honeymoon suite we find the hotel had cancelled our reservation. They called, but we didn't have an international phone set up yet, we were out of pocket fixing AA's mistakes. Our backup, my father in law who paid for the room, was asleep due to a 12+ hour time difference. 

I recognize that's not 100% on AA, but if AA had been successful with a single one of their earlier attempts to correct this, the timing wouldn't be an issue. 

We're still in the same clothes, but my wife and I are now sitting at the Doubletree in Queenstown. There was no availability for us at our original hotel. The staff their did their best, but I write this from updated Honeymoon suite - two twins beds in a small room.

Our luggage has no chance of getting to us before we have to pick up our RV rental tomorrow, and if we don't have our luggage there's little value in taking the RV for exploring. 

How do I deal with this? How much is AA responsible for in these cascading errors?

Different AA staff have said different things about us being compensated, and as royally messed up as this has been I'm not looking to milk the situation. I just want what is fair, that AA fix their mistake and make a meaningful attempt to apologize.

I never get much sleep and often can't check into a hotel upon arrival, so the first couple of days of the trip end up being miserable.

For my most recent trip, I decided to try one of the morning flights from New York to London. It was GREAT. Watched TV on the flight over, went straight to my hotel in London after I landed, went to sleep at an appropriate local time, and woke up the next morning with no jet lag whatsoever.

Since I couldn't find one online, I wanted to make a brief list of all the morning flight options for those who want to avoid the short red-eye on their next European trip. The big downside to these flights is that since they leave early in the morning and arrive late at night, it is difficult to add connections on either end (especially the London end) without overnighting.
