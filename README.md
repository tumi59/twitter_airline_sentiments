# "Flights" Subreddit Airline Sentiment Analysis

Using scrape.py, we collected hundreds of posts that explicitly mention the name of an airline. Using the data from each post, we were able to perform a sentiment analysis to determine if the feelings towards that airline were positive, negative, or neutral. Linear discriminant analysis was used to help find reoccuring topics/words. Common themes can be identified by combining these different metrics (e.g., if a specific airline has strict baggage rules or terrible customer service).

## Limitations

The findings from these analyses may not speak accurately to some airlines and should be taken with a grain of salt. The phenomenon of [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) may have skewed the data. If people are more likely to share experiences when they are negative, there are no positives to balance the results. This analysis, more than anything else, tells us, when people have a negative experience with an airline, what that experience is commonly about.
